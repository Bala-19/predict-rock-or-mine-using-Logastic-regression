Rock or Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether an object is a rock or a mine using sonar data. The sonar data contains information from 60 sonar signals bounced off various surfaces. The task is to classify the objects based on this data using a Logistic Regression model.

Dataset

The dataset used is the Sonar Dataset, which is a collection of 208 samples with 60 features each. Each sample is classified as either a rock or a mine:

R: Rock
M: Mine
Dataset Source
The dataset can be obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

Sonar Dataset
Data Structure
208 rows, representing different sonar signal readings.
60 columns, representing the amplitude of the sonar signals at different frequencies.
1 target variable: 'R' for Rock, 'M' for Mine.
